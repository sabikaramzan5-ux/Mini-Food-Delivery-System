# Mini-Food-Delivery-System
This is a mini-food-delivery-system project(intermediate level)
<br>
It just demonstrates how OOP concepts work like:
<br>
1-Inheritance
<br>
2-Aggregation
<br>
3-Association
<br>
4-Composition
<br>
5-Multiplicity
<br>
6-Polymorphism
<br>
Since it is intermediate level OOP project ,just to practice above concepts, it is not like fully real world "Delivery Systems" and has some limitations.
